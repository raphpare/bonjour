## Tree Shaking

Bonjour was designed to be able to do Treeshaking. This technique allows you to reduce the size of the final build by including only the code you use.

Example

```
import { B5rEvent } from 'b5r-bonjour';
import { B5rMonthView } from 'b5r-bonjour/lib/month-view';
import { B5rWeekView } from 'b5r-bonjour/lib/week-view';
```
